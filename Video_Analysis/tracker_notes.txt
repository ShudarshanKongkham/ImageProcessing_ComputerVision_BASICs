Difference Between MIL, KCF, and CSRT Trackers
MIL (Multiple Instance Learning) Tracker:

Algorithm: Uses a machine learning approach to track objects. It creates multiple positive and negative samples around the target and updates the model with these samples.
Pros: Robust to occlusions and can handle significant changes in the appearance of the object.
Cons: Slower compared to KCF and CSRT. May not be as accurate in some scenarios.
KCF (Kernelized Correlation Filters) Tracker:

Algorithm: Uses correlation filters for tracking. It is based on the idea of using the kernel trick to map the data into a higher-dimensional space.
Pros: Very fast and efficient. Suitable for real-time applications.
Cons: Less robust to occlusions and significant changes in the appearance of the object. May fail if the object undergoes drastic changes.
CSRT (Discriminative Correlation Filter with Channel and Spatial Reliability) Tracker:

Algorithm: An advanced version of the correlation filter tracker. It uses spatial reliability maps to improve the tracking performance.
Pros: More accurate and robust compared to KCF. Handles occlusions and changes in the appearance of the object better.
Cons: Slower than KCF but faster than MIL. Suitable for applications where accuracy is more important than speed.
Summary
MIL: Best for scenarios with occlusions and significant appearance changes but slower.
KCF: Best for real-time applications due to its speed but less robust to occlusions.
CSRT: A balance between accuracy and speed, more robust than KCF but slower.
