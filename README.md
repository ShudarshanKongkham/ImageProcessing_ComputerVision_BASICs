# Image Processing & Computer Vision Basics

This repository is a collection of projects focused on basic image processing and computer vision concepts using Python, OpenCV, and advanced models like YOLO.

## Projects

### Project 3: Object Tracking
- Detect objects using YOLO and track them using OpenCV trackers (MIL, KCF, CSRT).
- A simple GUI built with Tkinter allows you to select a tracker and start processing a video.
- **How to Run:** Navigate to the `Project3` directory and run `python submission.py`.

### Future Projects
- Additional projects on image segmentation, feature detection, optical flow, and more will be added.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- OpenCV
- NumPy
- Tkinter (usually included with Python)

Each project folder contains its own required files such as pre-trained models, configuration files, and sample videos/images.
